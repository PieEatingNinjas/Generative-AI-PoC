## Smart
When someone knows a lot about a subject but doesn't have any experience using that information.

## Wise

The model is like a representation of a piece of knowledge, without any context.

Our first goal is to create a PoC that follows the Crl + F model.

## What is out of scope?
- We don't want to spend a lot of time in data preprocessing.
